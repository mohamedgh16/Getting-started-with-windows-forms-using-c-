According to [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/?view=netdesktop-5.0) It provides one of the most productive ways to create desktop apps based on the visual designer provided in Visual Studio. Functionality such as drag-and-drop placement of visual controls makes it easy to build desktop apps.


With *windows forms* you can make different types of applications, from basic applications like a calculator and mini-games to high-level applications such as a library database management application that requires the connection of the database to the application.
